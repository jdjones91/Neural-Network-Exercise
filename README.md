# Neural-Network-Exercise

I built out a neural network for a housing dataset from Kaggle. Using tensorflow, matplotlib, and sklearn packages I was able to create, test, and visualize the trends in model learning between a training and testing set. 
- For example, I used a custom function to create the folowing graphs:

Finally, after a couple modifications to dense layers and use of early stopping, a final model was chosen, run on a testing dataset, and submitted to kaggle.
